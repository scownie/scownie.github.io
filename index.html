	<h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site</h1>
	<p>Iâ€™m a postgraduate Computer Science student at the University of Birmingham, hoping to pursue a career as a developer upon completion in September 2015.</p> 
	<p>Prior to undertaking postgraduate study I worked as a public relations consultant for a number of technology brands, from start-ups to blue-chips. </p>
	<p>The bulk of my programming experience is in Java. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of language and technology. Outside my university studies I'm working on several NLP-related projects, which will eventually be hosted on my GitHub page https://github.com/scownie/</p
