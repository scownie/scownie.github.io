# About me

Iâ€™m a postgraduate Computer Science student at the University of Birmingham. I hope to pursue a career as a developer upon completion in September 2015, but I'm yet to decide exactly which path I want to take. 

Before postgraduate study I worked as a public relations consultant for a number of technology brands, from start-ups to blue-chips. For more information about my professional and educational history, please see the C.V. tab.

The bulk of my programming experience is in Java. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of language and technology. Outside my university studies I'm working on several NLP-related projects, which I'll be adding to the Projects page soon.
