# About me

Thanks for visiting. Iâ€™m a postgraduate Computer Science student at the University of Birmingham, hoping to pursue a career as a developer upon completion in September 2015.

Prior to undertaking postgraduate study I worked as a public relations consultant for a number of technology brands, from start-ups to blue-chips.

The bulk of my programming experience is in Java. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of language and technology. Outside my university studies I'm working on several NLP-related projects, which I'll be adding to the Projects page soon
